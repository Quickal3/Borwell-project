# Borwell-project
first the program would ask the person the height, length and width.
the the program would use the infromation to calculate the surface area by using the equation width*height*2 + length*width*2 + height*length*2
Area of the floor by using the equation length*width
Amount of paint needed by using equation height*length*2 + height*width*2
volume by using equation length*width*height
finally prints the results with a sentence and changing the results to a string and using concatenation to be with the sentence
